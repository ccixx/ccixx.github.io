abstract: Coal mining alters the regional and local hydrogeological conditions and subsurface parameters, significantly impacting the hydrological cycle. Baseflow is particularly sensitive to changes in subsurface parameters and hydrogeological conditions. Therefore, studying the impact of coal mining on baseflow is crucial for understanding its effects on the water cycle. This paper investigates the applicability of 9 baseflow separation methods in the mining area of northern Shaanxi. The M-K and Pettitt tests are employed to determine the mutation years of baseflow. Finally, within the Budyko framework, the elasticity coefficient is calculated to estimate the changes in baseflow caused by variations in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and subsurface parameter n. The results indicate that: (1) The Chapman-Maxwell and the Boughton-Chapman separation method are the most suitable for the typical watersheds in the mining area of northern Shaanxi. (2) During the study period, baseflow experienced a mutation in the late 1990s and showed an overall declining trend. (3) The impact of coal mining activities on baseflow varies across different sub-watersheds, with the contribution size correlating well with the coal mining volume in each watershed.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Utilized Python to separate baseflow and conduct suitability analysis. Within the Budyko framework, calculated the elasticity coefficient to estimate baseflow changes caused by variations in precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and the subsurface parameter.
