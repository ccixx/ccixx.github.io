abstract: The Loess Plateau faces severe ecological and environmental challenges, which are both widespread and typical. Since the United Nations proposed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the evaluation and analysis of ecological sustainability have become critical. There is an urgent need to establish an ecological sustainability evaluation system suitable for this region and to study its driving mechanisms. Based on the SDGs, this paper constructs a localized comprehensive index system for the ecological space sustainability of the Loess Plateau, encompassing four dimensions and twelve specific indicators. By using the entropy method for objective and comprehensive weighting, we evaluate the overall and dimensional sustainability of the ecological space in this region. The GTWR model is used to analyze driving factors, and the Tapio model is employed to assess the coupling state between carbon emission intensity and ecological sustainability. The results show that:(1) During the study period, the ecological space sustainability of the Loess Plateau improved to some extent, with urban development having a negative impact on ecological sustainability, especially in areas along rivers. (2) There is significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the driving factors of ecological sustainability in the Loess Plateau, with human activities being the main influencing factor. (3) The relationship between ecological sustainability intensity and carbon emission intensity varies across regions.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Conducted a GIS-based evaluation of ecological sustainability in the Loess Plateau over the past decade, assessing both fractal and overall dimensions. Developed a localized indicator system and employed various models (such as RUSLE, Invest, Fragstats) to calculate the indicators. Additionally, investigated the relationship between ecological sustainability and carbon emissions under multiple driving factors using the Tapio and GTWR models.
